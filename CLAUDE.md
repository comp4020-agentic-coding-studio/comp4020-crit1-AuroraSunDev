# COMP4020 prototype

This is your starter repo for a COMP4020 prototype. C1's spec requires "Pure
HTML/CSS, deployed straight to GitHub Pages", so this repo runs the **bare**
stack option: no Vite, no TypeScript, no bundler. See
[Stack: bare HTML/CSS](#stack-bare-htmlcss-no-bundler) below before assuming
the template's defaults still apply. The **deployed site is what gets marked**
--- not this repo, and not "it works on my machine". It's marked live in Chrome against the deployed URL at two
viewports --- 1920×1080 (desktop) and 390×844 (phone) --- and both count in
full, so make that artefact good at both and use the checks below to know
whether it is.

What you're building this week — the spec — is published on the course website,
and this repo's name tells you which deliverable it is. Run the course plugin's
**start** skill at the start of each week: it pulls the right spec from the
course API, carries your harness forward from last week, and helps you turn the
spec's checkable lines into tests of your own. Read the spec before you build,
and see `spec/README.md` for how the checks in this repo relate to it.

## How to work in here

- Keep the dev server running (`pnpm dev`) so you see changes as you make them.
- Before you push, run `pnpm check`. It runs most of what CI runs --- build,
  lint, and the spec --- so you catch those in seconds instead of waiting for
  the pipeline. The links check, the evidence check, the secrets scan, and the
  deploy itself only run in CI; run `pnpm dlx linkinator ./dist --silent`
  locally against a fresh `pnpm build` for the links check without waiting for
  CI.
- To see what the page actually looks like rather than what you assume it looks
  like, open it in a browser (the `agent-browser` CLI, documented on
  [the course site](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/topics/backpressure/#agent-browser-the-rendered-page-as-ground-truth),
  works well for this). The rendered page is the truth; your mental model of it
  isn't.
- When a check fails, read its output before changing anything. Each check below
  names what it measures, and the failure message is the instruction: it tells
  you the file, the line, or the contract. Treat a red check as authoritative
  --- the page is wrong until the check is green, not until you decide it should
  be.
- Commit when the checks pass. Never commit a red state.

## The checks (your sensors)

CI runs these on every push once your repo is public. GitHub's checks UI shows
two jobs, `check` and `deploy` --- not one status per sensor below --- and
within `check` the steps run in sequence (`pnpm check` chains typecheck, build,
lint, and the spec with `&&`), so an early failure like a broken build stops the
later sensors from running for that push; fix it and push again to see the rest.
While the repo is private (all week, until you ship) the CI jobs stay skipped
--- `pnpm check` is the same roster on your machine, and it's the faster loop
anyway. They aren't hoops. Each is a different way of finding out something true
about the site that you can't reliably see by looking at it.

- **build** --- `pnpm build` runs `scripts/build.mjs`, which copies the source
  tree into `dist/` (no bundler, since there's no TypeScript or JS to bundle).
  A build failure means the deployed site is broken or stale, so nothing else
  matters until this is green.
- **deploy / online** --- the live GitHub Pages URL must load and return the
  page you expect. An asset that 404s on the deployed URL counts as broken even
  if it loads locally.
- **spec** --- `spec/invariants.test.ts` asserts what's true of any good
  website, whatever the week's brief asks; the tests you write for the week's
  own spec run alongside it (any `spec/*.test.ts`). A failure names the contract
  you haven't met yet.
- **lint** --- `stylelint` for CSS. There's no `oxlint`/TypeScript step: the
  site has no JS. Read the rule stylelint names.
- **tests** --- any other tests you write, wherever you put them (co-located
  with your source is fine, not just `spec/`), must pass. Vitest picks up both
  this and the spec suite in one `vitest run`, the last step of `pnpm check`. A
  failing test is a claim about the site that's no longer true.
- **evidence** (`pnpm check:evidence`) --- checks your process evidence:
  `PROCESS.md`'s citations resolve to real commits, the current deliverable's
  exact reflection is in `reflections/` (worked out from this repo's name
  against the public course API), and your `CLAUDE.md` is present. Evidence
  gates the deploy --- `deploy` needs `check` to pass, so failing evidence
  blocks the deploy alongside everything else. See
  [Your process is part of the mark](#your-process-is-part-of-the-mark) below,
  and the course website's
  [assessment page](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/topics/assessment/#what-you-submit)
  for what counts as evidence.
- **links** --- internal links must resolve. A broken link is a dead end you
  didn't mean to ship.
- **secrets** --- the repo is scanned for committed credentials. Never put a
  key, token, or password in a tracked file. If one leaks, rotate it. A local
  pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, installed by `pnpm install`) also
  blocks any commit containing something shaped like an API key --- by the time
  CI sees a key it's already pushed, so the hook is the sensor that matters.

Nothing here measures **accessibility** or **performance** --- wiring those
sensors (`axe-core`, Lighthouse, or whatever you choose) is your work, and later
in the course the spec will ask you to show how you tested both. When you do,
read a green performance result honestly: it's a lab estimate from one run on a
CI machine, not proof the site is fast for real users.

## Stack: bare HTML/CSS, no bundler

The template ships Vite + TypeScript by default; this repo removed both
(`main.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `.oxlintrc.json` are gone) to
match the spec's "Pure HTML/CSS, deployed straight to GitHub Pages" line.
Don't reintroduce a `<script>` tag or a `.ts`/`.js` file without checking the
spec first --- Crit 1 explicitly rules out JavaScript.

- `pnpm build` runs `scripts/build.mjs`: a plain copy of every top-level file
  or directory into `dist/`, except a hardcoded skip-list of source-only
  files (`package.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `spec/`, `scripts/`, etc.). Add a new
  page by adding a `.html` file at the repo root and linking it --- no config
  needed, same as the template's Vite setup, just without the bundler.
- `pnpm dev` runs `scripts/dev-server.mjs`, a zero-dependency static server
  (`node:http`), since there's no build-on-save step to watch for.
- Every internal link uses a relative `.html` path (`./about.html`, not
  `./about`), so the site works under GitHub Pages' subpath
  (`…github.io/<repo>/`) without any base-path config.

The whole contract other stacks would still need to satisfy, if you ever swap
again: `pnpm build` emits the complete site into `dist/`, `check`/
`check:evidence`/`build` keep working, and whatever lands in `dist/` passes
`spec/invariants.test.ts`.

## Your process is part of the mark

The deployed page is only half of it. How you got there is marked too: your
commit history, your agent files, and the decisions visible across them. The
checks above can't see any of that, so a person reads it directly --- which
means building legibly is part of building well.

- **Commit as you go.** Small, frequent commits are the record of how the work
  came together, and that record is read, not just the final state. A trail that
  grew alongside the code is the strongest evidence of your process; a single
  dump the night before is the weakest.
- **Keep a process overview** (`PROCESS.md`). A short reading-guide, not an
  essay: what you built, the moments that mattered --- each pointing at a
  commit, a `CLAUDE.md` change, or a prompt and the commit it produced --- and
  where to look in the history. It points a marker at the evidence; it doesn't
  stand in for it, and claims the history doesn't back don't count. The
  `PROCESS.md` in this repo is a template showing the shape and the citation
  format (link text the commit hash or range, target the commit or compare URL);
  `pnpm check:evidence` verifies your citations resolve to real commits before
  you ship. Markers follow those citations and don't trawl the repo for evidence
  you didn't cite.
- **Write your reflection in `reflections/`** --- a short markdown file in this
  repo, named for the deliverable it answers, so the number in the filename is
  the number in this repo's name (`crit-1.md` in `comp4020-crit1-<you>`,
  `assignment-1.md` in `comp4020-ass1-<you>`); `reflections/README.md` has the
  full rule. `pnpm check:evidence` checks the exact current name against the
  course API, not merely the presence of any well-named file. It answers the two
  standing prompts: the breakthrough that moved the work forward, and what this
  work changed about the developer you want to be. It stays out of the deployed
  site. It's due at the cutoff, and it's the written half of your crit
  contribution.
- **This file is process evidence.** The harness you build to direct the agent,
  this `CLAUDE.md` and any `AGENTS.md`, is itself read as part of how you
  worked. Keep it honest and current (see below).

You don't need a name, a student number, or any identity file in the repo: we
know whose repo it is. Spend the effort on the work.

## Project editing conventions

Standing conventions, expected to apply across COMP4020 deliverables:

- Verify requirement-sensitive decisions against the current official course
  source, using the handbook skill or published specification where
  available, rather than relying on memory or an earlier paraphrase.
- Follow the technology requirements of the *current* deliverable rather than
  assuming one stack applies for the whole course --- check the brief before
  assuming plain HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or any other stack is expected.
- Follow the routing and deployment requirements of the current deliverable.
  For static multi-page sites deployed under a GitHub Pages repository
  subpath, use repository-safe relative links such as `./page.html`.
- Prefer small, targeted edits over unrelated redesign --- change what the
  task names, not what's around it.
- Run `pnpm check` after relevant code or layout changes, before calling it
  done.
- Check layout changes at both graded viewports, 1920x1080 and 390x844 ---
  both count in full.
- Explain broad or destructive changes (deleting files, rewriting several
  rules, restructuring pages) and wait for approval before applying them.

Current-deliverable note, not a standing rule:

- For this Crit 1 repository, preserve the current bare HTML/CSS stack
  unless the official C1 brief or an approved change requires otherwise. Do
  not generalise this restriction to later COMP4020 deliverables.

## This file is yours

This CLAUDE.md is a starting point, not a fixed rulebook. As you learn what your
prototype needs --- a convention to hold the agent to, a sensor that keeps
catching you out, a fact about the stack the agent keeps getting wrong --- write
it down here. Growing this file is the work of harness engineering, and the gap
between this boilerplate and your own version is part of what your prototype
says about the developer you're becoming.
